rtweet's default authentication mechanism (`auth_setup_default()`) allows you to act on behalf of your personal Twitter account, as if you were performing actions on twitter.com.
This vignette shows you how to use two other authentication mechanisms useful for other scenarios:

-   App authentication allows you to act as if you were a Twitter app.
    You can't perform operations that a user would (like posting a tweet or reading a DM), but in return you get higher rate limits on operations like searching for tweets.

-   Bot authentication allows you to create a fully automated Twitter bot that performs actions on its own behalf rather than on behalf of a human.

In either case, you'll need to start by creating a Twitter app.
An app provides a

To do: explain what a twitter app is and what makes these systems different.

so this vignette will first walk you through that process.
You'll then learn how to create and save the objects needed to use these two new types of authentication.

```{r}
library(rtweet)
```

## Creating a Twitter app

To create a Twitter app, you need to first apply for a developer account by following the instructions at <https://developer.twitter.com>.
Once you have acquired a developer account (which may take several hours), navigate to the [developer portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/projects-and-apps) and click the "Create App" button at the bottom of the page.
You'll need to name your app: the name is unimportant for our purposes, but needs to be unique across all twitter apps.

After you've created your app, you'll see a screen that gives you some important information.
You'll only see this once, so make sure to record it in a secure location.

(Don't worry if you forget to save them: you can always create ones by clicking the "regenerate" button on the "keys and tokens" page.)

## Setup

Now you're ready to tell rtweet how to authenticate using your app.
You'll call either `rtweet_app()` or `rtweet_bot()` depending on whether you want app authentication or bot authentication as described above.

### rtweet_app()

To use app based authentication, run the following code:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
auth <- rtweet_app()
```

This will prompt you to enter the bearer token that you recorded earlier.
It's good practice to only provide secrets interactively, because that makes it harder to accidentally share them in either your `.Rhistory` or an `.R` file.

### `rtweet_bot()`

Bot based authentication works similarly:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
auth <- rtweet_bot()
```

But you'll need more data --- as well as the API key and secret you recorded earlier, you'll also need to generate a "Access token and secret" which you can get by clicking the "Generate" button on the Keys and Tokens page:

## Default auth

Now you have an auth object that you can provide to the `token` argument of any rtweet function:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
df <- search_tweets("#rstats", token = auth)
```

It's a good idea to do this once to check that you've entered everything correctly, but it'd be annoying if you had to pass this object around every single time.
Instead, you can use `auth_use()` to set this as the default for the remainder of the session:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
auth_as(auth)
```

## Saving and loading

`auth_use()` only lasts for a single session; if you close and re-open R, you'll need to repeat the whole process.
This would be annoying so rtweet also provides a way to save and reload auth across sessions:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
auth_save(auth, "some-name")
```

The second argument to `auth_save()` can be any string.
It just needs to be meaningful to you so that it makes sense when you re-load it in a future session with `auth_as()`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
auth_as("some-name")
```

You can see all the authentication options you have saved with `auth_list()`.
