\title{(DEPRECATED) Get the most recent direct messages sent to the authenticating user.}
\usage{
direct_messages_received(
  since_id = NULL,
  max_id = NULL,
  n = 200,
  parse = TRUE,
  token = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{since_id}{optional Returns results with an ID greater than
(that is, more recent than) the specified ID. There are limits to
the number of Tweets which can be accessed through the API. If
the limit of Tweets has occurred since the since_id, the since_id
will be forced to the oldest ID available.}

\item{max_id}{Character, returns results with an ID less than (that is,
older than) or equal to \code{max_id}.}

\item{n}{optional Specifies the number of direct messages to try
and retrieve, up to a maximum of 200. The value of count is best
thought of as a limit to the number of Tweets to return because
suspended or deleted content is removed after the count has been
applied.}

\item{parse}{The default, \code{TRUE}, indicates that the result should
be parsed into a convenient R data structure like a list or data frame.
This protects you from the vagaries of the twitter API. Use \code{FALSE}
to return the "raw" list produced by the JSON returned from the twitter
API.}

\item{token}{Expert use only. Use this to override authentication for
a single API call. In most cases you are better off changing the
default for all calls. See \code{\link[=auth_as]{auth_as()}} for details.}
}
\value{
Return object converted to nested list. If status code of
response object is not 200, the response object is returned
directly.
}
\description{
Retrieves up to 200 of the most recently received direct messages
by the authenticating (home) user. This function requires access
token with read, write, and direct messages access.
}
\details{
Includes detailed information about the sender and
recipient user. You can request up to 200 direct messages per
call, and only the most recent 200 direct messages will be available using
this endpoint.

Important: This method requires an access token with read,
write, and direct message permissions. If you own the Twitter application,
you can change permissions through Twitter's developer portal. Once you
have made changes to the application permission settings, you will need to
regenerate your token before those effect of those changes can
take effect.
