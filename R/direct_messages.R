#' Get direct messages sent to and received by the authenticating user from the
#' past 30 days
#'
#' Returns all Direct Message events (both sent and received) within the last 30
#' days. Sorted in reverse-chronological order.
#'
#' @param n optional Specifies the number of direct messages to try
#'   and retrieve, up to a maximum of 50.
#' @param next_cursor If there are more than 200 DMs in the last 30 days,
#'   responses will include a next_cursor value, which can be supplied in

#' @inheritParams lookup_users
#' @return Return parsed or non-parsed response object.

#' (DEPRECATED) Get the most recent direct messages sent to the authenticating user.
#'
#' Retrieves up to 200 of the most recently received direct messages
#' by the authenticating (home) user. This function requires access
#' token with read, write, and direct messages access.
#'
#' @param since_id optional Returns results with an ID greater than
#'   (that is, more recent than) the specified ID. There are limits to
#'   the number of Tweets which can be accessed through the API. If
#'   the limit of Tweets has occurred since the since_id, the since_id
#'   will be forced to the oldest ID available.
#' @param max_id Character, returns results with an ID less than (that is,
#'   older than) or equal to `max_id`.
#' @param n optional Specifies the number of direct messages to try
#'   and retrieve, up to a maximum of 200. The value of count is best
#'   thought of as a limit to the number of Tweets to return because
#'   suspended or deleted content is removed after the count has been
#'   applied.
#' @inheritParams lookup_users
#' @return Return object converted to nested list. If status code of
#'   response object is not 200, the response object is returned
#'   directly.
